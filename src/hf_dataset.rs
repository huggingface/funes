//! Append and reindex for the remote HF Lance dataset.
//!
//! [`append`] adds rows; [`reindex`] folds the unindexed backlog into the FTS/IVF indexes. Each
//! runs a native Lance op and lands the result in one `create_commit` on the branch, guarded by a
//! `parent_commit` against the head it read — atomic. Each is a single attempt: if the head moved
//! first it reports a conflict ([`Appended::Conflict`] / [`Reindexed::Conflict`]) and the caller
//! retries against the new head.
//!
//! The result goes up as a *single* `create_commit` because Lance, left to write straight to
//! `hf://`, would commit each file on its own: that store is OpenDAL's HuggingFace service, where
//! every `put` is its own git commit.
//!
//! ```text
//!   Lance Dataset → object_store → OpenDAL hf service → HF Hub
//!       put = XET upload + one git commit, per file
//! ```
//!
//! A multi-file write would then be several commits — non-atomic, no CAS. So the op runs through a
//! [`CaptureStore`](crate::capture_store::CaptureStore) installed via Lance's
//! [`WrappingObjectStore`] seam: Lance's writes are captured in memory instead of hitting the Hub,
//! and we ship the whole set as one guarded `create_commit`.
//!
//! # Why this shape
//!
//! **Intercept at the object-store layer.** Every file an append or optimize produces — data
//! fragment, manifest, transaction, index — is written through `object_store`, so it is the one
//! hook that captures the *whole* write set with no knowledge of Lance's on-disk layout. A
//! narrower seam can't do it: a custom `CommitHandler` only governs the final manifest commit and
//! never sees the data fragments, which are written earlier.
//!
//! **Decorate Lance's store rather than inject our own.** Lance does support dependency injection
//! (`DatasetBuilder::with_object_store`, now deprecated, or an `ObjectStoreProvider`), but both
//! make *us* construct the HF store — reproducing Lance's OpenDAL-hf setup, XET wiring, and
//! token/revision plumbing, and keeping it in lockstep. [`WrappingObjectStore`] instead hands us
//! the store Lance already built (`wrap`'s `original`), so we decorate it and never reconstruct
//! anything. It is also the non-deprecated seam.
